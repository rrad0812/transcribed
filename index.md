# The quick introduction to Jam.py

The idea for adding this documents in Jam.Py documentation was:
- Transfer video tutorials, created by *Mr. Andrew Yushew*, in a text format and
- Show some characteristic parts of code that often appear and repeat in certain places.

Thus, the adoption of general principles for application development with this 
exceptional framework should be greatly facilitated.
